/*
 * Shipyard class for managing spaceship constructions and upgrades
 * Uses I/O streams for saving.loading shipyard state
 * Uses ExecutorService for concurrent ship building
 */

/*
 * Features added:
 * Ship Construction: Player can build ships asynchronously (multithreading)
 * Ship Upgrades: Upgrades ships, increasing their stats
 * Save and Load: Fleet persists between game sessions using file I/O (OOS)
 * Concurrency Handling: Uses ExecutorService for shipbuilding
 * Interactive Testing: main method allows quick testing of shipyard features
